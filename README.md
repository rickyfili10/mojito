# The Mojito Project by Blackat

## Why is called "mojito" like the cocktail? 🍸
This project is called "Mojito" beacuse while the developers were coding this project, they were drinking non-alcoholic mojitos (maked by @rickyfili10)

# What's that? 🤔
Mojito is swiss army knife for ethical hacking (educational purposes only) and runs on a raspberry pi 0 w/wh that use a wavseshare 1.44 inch lcd HAT display. It have a collection of hacking tools and it is based on Kali Linux.

## USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

# REQUIREMENTS 📃
  - Wavseshare 1.44 inch lcd HAT display 
  - Raspberry pi 0 w/wh 
  - 16 GB sd card (You need much less, but you might need 16 GB for additional packages)
  - An external usb antenna that support packet injection and monitor mode. We recommend RTL8812BU or RTL8822BU        Chipsets
# HOW TO SETUP AND INSTALL MOJITO? 
1. Flash and setup kali linux for raspberry pi 0 wh
2. Put a wpa_supplicant.conf with your wifi information inside the sd card and create a file called "ssh" with nothing inside.
⚠️ REMEMBER: THE PASSWORD WILL BE ALWAYS "kali" ⚠️
4. Connect to it using ssh, for example:
```
ssh kali@192.168.1.xxx
```
You can see Mojito ip form your WiFi.
If it doesn't seem to appear, try connecting it to an HDMI and plugging a keyboard into it to try to connect automatically.<br>
You can use this to connect manually from an hdmi and keyboard setup
```
sudo iwconfig wlan0 up
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "{your wifi SSID}" password "{your wifi password}"
sudo enable ssh
sudo start ssh
```
5. Install and setup requisites with the commands below
